# TripWise – Travel Management System

**TripWise** is a software engineering university project designed to simulate the backend logic of a travel platform. It allows users to register as either **travellers** or **guides**, manage trips with dynamic filters, apply as a guide, and simulate agency approval workflows.

## 📌 Features

- Traveller and guide account management  
- Trip creation, editing, and deletion (by admin or agency)  
- Dynamic filters to search trips by preferences  
- Guide application system with approval flow  
- Skill-based guide eligibility checks  
- Notification system for application status updates

---

## 📐 Software Design

The project follows standard software engineering practices and includes:

- **Use Case Diagrams** and detailed Use Case Templates  
- **Mockups** for key user interfaces (not implemented)  
- **Class Diagram** for object-oriented structure  
- Manager classes for business logic separation:
  - `TripManager`, `ApplicationManager`, `ActivityManager`, `NotificationManager`

---

## ⚙️ Technologies

- Language: `Java`  
- UML diagrams: `StarUML`  
- Mockups: `Balsamiq` / `Figma`  
- No frontend implementation – mockups only

## 📄 Notes

This is a theoretical project developed as part of the **Software Engineering** course at the University of Florence. It focuses on proper modeling and documentation rather than full-stack implementation.
